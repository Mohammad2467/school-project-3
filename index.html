        <p>The Michael J. Petrides School is a public school located at 715 Ocean Terrace in Staten Island, New York. It was created by Board of Education officials and named for their late colleague and College of Staten Island professor, Michael J. Petrides (1941â€“1994). The school opened in 1995, on the former campus of the college. Students apply to attend the school through a lottery system. However, 8th graders going into high school, who score in the top 2% on the ELA 7th grade test, can receive auto-admission if Petrides is the first choice on their application. The current principal is Joanne Buckheit.

            Petrides educates students from Kindergarten through 12th, or senior year in high school. It has an assistant principal for each grade category (early childhood, elementary, middle school, high school)..</p>

Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less complicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

                Set on what was once was the College of Staten Island campus, P.S. 80 serves students from kindergarten through high-school. The school opened in 1995, had its first graduating class in 2001. Its first group to complete all 13 years of schooling graduated in 2008.

                The school enrolls about 90-100 pupils per grade from kindergarten through middle school and about 125 per grade in high school. Close to 1,000 students apply for about 75-90 kindergarten seats, and the school receives more than 1,200 applications for the 40 to 50 seats that open in 9th grade. Teachers work at every academic level, from the youngest grades through high school, and the "seamless" curriculum promises a smooth progression from year to year, with ample opportunity for arts, music, Advanced Placement classes, and electives. Students in grades 6 through 12 are assigned personal laptops, and can take advantage of the schoolâ€™s technology resources. The school features hallways named with street signs for famous artists, architects, and inventors.

                High-school students have the opportunity to travel overseas. Destinations have included Italy, Hungary, and Austria. Vermont, Michigan, and Hawaii were also destinations. Fundraisers are also held to help finance the high school's annual trip Habitat for Humanity. In addition, high school students can work with younger students in the elementary school, as classroom student mentors.
                <br>
                <b>2. Admissions:</b>
                Admissions are by lottery for grades K-8. For kindergarten, the school typically receives more than 800 applications for 75-90 seats, of which 15 are reserved for siblings of current students (separate lottery). The handful of open seats in the upper grades are filled by lottery, as well. In 9th grade, class sizes get larger and an extra class is added to the grade. Thousands of students apply for a total of 40 to 55 new seats. These seats are filled through the city's "educational option" formula, designed to achieve a mix of low, average, and high-performing students.
                <br>
                <b>3. Controversy:</b>
                Within the past, there had been certain discrepancies according to the school's enrollment policy under the past principal. This was highlighted by a noticeable prevalence to kin relations within the student body and noted recommendations within an alleged random basis lottery system for enrollment. These were recorded in a 1998 investigation report. The report also recorded the absence of critical records that would determine the extent of the irregularities.
